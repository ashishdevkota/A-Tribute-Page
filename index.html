            Laxmi Prasad Devkota (Nepali: लक्ष्मीप्रसाद देवकोटा) (1909-1959) was
            a Nepali poet, playwright, and novelist. Honored with the title of
            Mahakabi in Nepali literature, he was known as a poet with a golden
            heart. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous literary
            figure in Nepal. Some of his popular works include the best-selling
            Muna Madan, along with Sulochana, Kunjini, Bhikhari, and Shakuntala.

          <p>
            Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of
            the language. In 1930 he wrote Muna Madan a long narrative poem in a
            popular Jhyaure bhaka folk tune.Muna Madan is undoubtedly the
            best-selling book in the history of Nepali literature. The poem
            describes the thematic hardships of the journey: the grief of
            separation, the itching of longing, and the torment of death. The
            following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently
            quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and
            compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese
            culture.

          <blockquote>
            "क्षेत्रीको छोरो यो पाउ छुन्छ, घिनले छुँदैन मानिस ठूलो दिलले हुन्छ
            जातले हुँदैन !"
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            The son of a Kshatriya touches your feet not with hatred but with
            love. A man's greatness is determined by his heart; not by his caste
            or lineage.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Devkota, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939,
            wrote a free-verse poem Pagal (Nepali: पागल, lit. 'The Lunatic').
            The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one
            of the best Nepali language poems.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "जरुर साथी म पागल ! यस्तै छ मेरो हाल । म शब्दलाई देख्दछु ! दृश्यलाई
            सुन्दछु ! बासनालाई संबाद लिन्छु । आकाशभन्दा पातालका कुरालाई छुन्छु ।
            ती कुरा, जसको अस्तित्व लोक मान्दैंन जसको आकार संसार जान्दैन !"
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            Surely, my friend, I am mad, That’s exactly what I am! I see a word,
            Hear sights, Taste smells, I touch things thinner than air, Those
            things, Whose existence the world denies, Whose shapes the world
            does not know.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Besides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the
            essay genre. He is considered the father of the modern Nepali essay.
            He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional
            rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial
            style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings and
            eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in
            tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless
            criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali
            society. An essay titled Bhaladmi (Nepali: भलादमी, lit. 'Gentleman')
            or criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people
            based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their
            actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled Ke Nepal
            Sano Cha? (Nepali: के नेपाल सानो छ?, lit. 'Is Nepal is small'), he
            expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the
            colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching
            all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays
            book entitled Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha (Nepali: लक्ष्मी
            निबन्धसङ्‌ग्रह).[3] Devkota also translated William Shakespeare's
            play Hamlet into Nepali.
